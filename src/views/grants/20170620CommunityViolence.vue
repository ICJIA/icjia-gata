<!-- START CONTENT --------------------------------------------------- -->



<p>The purpose of this grant opportunity is to fund direct services for victims of community violence. Applicants may request a minimum of <span>$</span>75,000 to a maximum of $1,000,000 in federal funding for use over a 12-month period. The term of the grant agreement will commence upon its effective date. Based on program performance and fund availability, ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.</p>



<h3 id="community-violence-defined">COMMUNITY VIOLENCE DEFINED:</h3>

<p>For purposes of this solicitation, Community Violence includes adult victims of violent crime  and minor victims who directly experience or witness violent crime in the home, school, work or neighborhood.  </p>

<p>In addition, domestic and sexual violence are included under this focus area with the following parameters: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Domestic and sexual violence should not be the primary focus of victimization under this funding. Agencies who wish to primarily serve victims of these crimes, should apply for funding through the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence and/or the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault.  </li>
<li>Domestic and sexual violence victimization may emerge when serving community violence victims. Therefore applicants must develop a written agreement and working relationship with experienced domestic and sexual violence agencies so that clients have easy access to staff appropriately trained in domestic and sexual violence victim services. Applications must include a signed letter of agreement in which both parties agree to provide domestic and sexual violence consultation and/or training when needed, and referral process where appropriate. </li>
<li>The applicant agency will refer clients to a specialized victim service agency in cases where it is appropriate. For example, referral to a specialized victim service agency must take place if child sexual abuse emerges in the course of service delivery and agency staff do not have the clinical skills to address it. </li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="/static/grants/2017CommunityViolence/VOCAComunityViolenceFinalNOFO062017.pdf">Notice of Funding Opportunity</a>, for program design, staff, and training requirements.</p>
