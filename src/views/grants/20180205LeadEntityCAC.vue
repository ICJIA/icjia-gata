                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>ICJIA is the state agency charged with the administration of the Illinois’ Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)
                            Victim Assistance Formula Grant Program. This program is supported by fines and penalties levied
                            against criminals convicted of federal crimes and allocated to states by formula by the Office
                            for Victims of Crime of the U.S. Department of Justice. In federal fiscal year 2016, Illinois
                            received a VOCA award of $87 million.</p>
                        <p>VOCA grants must support the provision of direct services to victims of violent crime. States are
                            required to allocate a minimum of 10 percent of funds received for services to each of the following:
                            victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, and underserved victims of violent
                            crime. VOCA funds may not be used to supplant or replace state and local funds that would otherwise
                            be available for crime victim services and must be used to develop new projects or expand existing
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>For more information on the VOCA Program please visit:

                        <p>Last year, ICJIA completed a statewide assessment of victim services in Illinois. The report was
                            presented to the Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee for consultation and coordination with other
                            state agencies and victim stakeholder groups. The final report’s recommendations were approved
                            by the ICJIA Board in January 2017. These recommendations outline a comprehensive plan to address
                            victims’ needs in Illinois and are reflected in this funding opportunity Please see the following
                            link to access the report and recommendations:

                        <p>The Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee made a priority of strengthening and expansion of core services
                            for victims of crime. To fulfill this priority, ICJIA made available $7.1 million in VOCA grant
                            funding for core services and related support costs for minor victims of abuse services. These
                            funds will be made available to the Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI).</p>
