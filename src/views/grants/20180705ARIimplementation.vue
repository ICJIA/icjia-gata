            <!-- <h1 id="adult-redeploy-illinois-notice-of-funding-opportunity-sfy19-implementation-grant">Adult Redeploy Illinois Notice of Funding Opportunity: SFY19 Implementation Grant</h1> -->
            <p>The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for SFY19 Adult Redeploy Illinois
              implementation grants. A total of $700,000 in SFY19 Adult Redeploy Illinois funding is available through this
              solicitation for use over a 12-month period.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Application deadline: August 6, 2018</strong>
            </p>
            <h2 id="program-requirements">Program Requirements</h2>
            <p>ARI SFY18 funded jurisdictions with a completed local plan may apply for implementation funds. Preference will
              be given to jurisdictions that received a planning grant in SFY18.</p>
            <p>
              <em>Assessment of Risk, Assets, and Needs</em>
            </p>
            <p>ARI sites must utilize validated assessment instruments to guide supervision and programming decisions.</p>
            <p>
              <em>Evidence-based Practices</em>
            </p>
            <p>ARI funds must be used to invest in local programs, services, and protocols that have been demonstrated by research
              to reduce recidivism.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Performance Measurement</em>
            </p>
            <p>Every ARI site must collect and report performance measurement data quarterly as a condition of funding. The
              Crime Reduction Act specifically requires the following to be measured: recidivism, rate of revocations, employment
              rates, education achievement, successful completion of substance abuse treatment programs, and payment of victim
              restitution.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Reduction Goal &amp; Reimbursement Provision</em>
            </p>
            <p>In exchange for funds, jurisdictions must agree to reduce by 25 percent the number of offenders committed to
              IDOC from a defined target population or else face a penalty. The reduction goal is based on the jurisdictionsâ€™
              average number of commitments over the past three years according to IDOC data. Once granted funds, sites are
              required to collect data and regularly report on progress. Jurisdictions having difficulty meeting their reduction
              goals are provided technical assistance. They can propose a corrective action plan to meet an adjusted target
              or, as a penalty, prepare to reimburse a portion of the grant at the discretion of the ARI Oversight Board.</p>
            <p>
              <em>Problem-Solving Court Certification</em>
            </p>
            <p>If the proposed program model for ARI implementation is a problem-solving court (PSC), the jurisdiction must
              either be certified or in the process of being certified through the Administrative Office of the Illinois
              Courts. ARI funds can be used to support initial staffing, training, and administrative support throughout
              the certification process; however, no funds can be used to provide services until the PSC is certified and
              able to enroll participants.</p>
            <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility Information</h2>
            <p>Agencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal,
              <a href="http://www.grants.illinois.gov">www.grants.illinois.gov</a>, to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA
              pre-qualification process and received approval of their Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) by the date of
              application to be considered for funding. Applications from agencies that have not received ICQ approval will
              not be reviewed.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Eligible applicants are limited to agencies operating SFY18 Adult Redeploy Illinois-funded programs.</strong>
            </p>
