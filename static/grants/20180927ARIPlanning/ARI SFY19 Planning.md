# Adult Redeploy Illinois Notice of Funding Opportunity: SFY19 Planning Grant 

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for SFY19 Adult Redeploy Illinois planning grants. A total of $200,000 in SFY19 Adult Redeploy Illinois funding is available through this solicitation for use over a six-month period. 

County applicants may request a planning grant to convene stakeholders, analyze data, and conduct other activities in the design of a local ARI program to divert probation-eligible offenders from prison to community-based supervision and services. As part of the planning grant process, applicants will be expected to gather and analyze relevant criminal justice system data, including, but not limited to, current services offered, services needed, strategies for service delivery, potential eligible populations, local governance issues, data collection and analysis capabilities, and estimated costs of alternatives to incarceration. The process culminates in the development and submission of a local ARI implementation plan.


**Application deadline: October 26, 2018**

## Program Requirements

*Planning Multi-Disciplinary Team*

Each applicant should identify a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to oversee and execute the planning process, representing the criminal justice spectrum (e.g., judiciary, prosecution, defense, probation) and the community (e.g., treatment providers, social services, business) to guide planning. Please list titles, not proper names, of all partners.

*Evidence-based Practices*

ARI funds must be used to invest in local programs, services, and protocols that have been demonstrated by research to reduce recidivism. 

*Planning Activities*

Funds are to be used solely for developing a local plan to implement ARI to expand alternatives to incarceration. Uses of planning grant funds may include, but are not limited to: 

 •	Employing an outside facilitator or strategic planning consultant.

•	Conducting an outside or in-house data analysis.

•	Providing stakeholder training.

•	Conducting site visits to observe successful diversion programs.

•	Community resource mapping.

Funds may not be used for capital expenditures, renovations or remodeling, or any food and beverage purchases. In addition, ARI funds shall not be used to supplant existing federal, state, county, or locally funded programs. 

*Local Plan* 

At the end of the planning period of performance, funded jurisdictions must complete and submit a local ARI implementation plan using the standard plan template (available at http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy/standard-plan.cfm). Jurisdictions are under no obligation to implement the plan; however, a letter stating why the plan will not be implemented, or a detailed explanation with supporting evidence as to why a plan was not developed, must be submitted by the end of the performance period in conjunction with periodic progress reports, on or before July 15, 2019.
