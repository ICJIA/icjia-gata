# ICJIA Grant Accountability and Transparency Act

> The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, also known as GATA, was passed by the Illinois Legislature in 2014.

> GATA confirms ICJIA’s commitment to the Federal Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, which went into effect in December 2014. The Uniform Guidance already applies to all federal grants and federal pass-through funds. GATA also requires Illinois’ state grants to follow these federal rules for grants which are state funded. This landmark legislations will increase accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds. Once fully implemented, it will unify processes and reduce administrative burdens for state agencies and grantees.
