**Application Deadline: October 25, 2018 at 11:59pm.**

## PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

Applicants may request funding under one or more categories. 

_**Model 1**_

**Post-Overdose Response.** This model features a response initiated by a law enforcement officer after emergency administration of medication to reverse overdose. The post-overdose response may be multi-disciplinary and may include the distribution of naloxone, in-person contact, relationship building, and access to treatment. Example: Quick Response Team.

_**Model 2**_

**Self-Referral Response.** This response is initiated by an individual by going to a police station or otherwise contacting a police officer or law enforcement agency and acknowledging their own substance misuse and need for treatment. The response offers individuals assistance in obtaining substance use disorder treatment. Examples: Safe Passage, A Way Out.

_**Model 3**_

**Active Outreach Response.** This response is initiated by a police officer through proactive identification of persons likely to misuse substances or have a substance use disorder. Law enforcement intentionally seeks out and identifies individuals who may need help, and a warm handoff is made to a service provider who engages them in treatment. 

_**Model 4**_

**Community Engagement Response.** This response is initiated by a police officer or law enforcement agency in response to a notification from a community member when no criminal charges are present.

_**Model 5**_

**Officer Intervention Response.** These are commonly referred to as pre-arrest diversion programs. The response occurs when criminal charges are present but held in abeyance or citations issued with requirement of treatment.

To be eligible for funding, deflection programs must be run by a municipal law enforcement agency, county sheriff’s office of this State, the Department of State Police, or other law enforcement agency whose officers, by statute, are granted and authorized by Public Act 100-1025 to exercise powers like those conferred upon any peace officer employed by a law enforcement agency of this State. Private and not-for-profit entities are not eligible to apply.

- An Implementing Agency in this context is a law enforcement agency which will apply for the grant, enter into the inter-governmental grant agreement with the Authority, accept and account for grant funds, and meet all Authority reporting and compliance requirements.

- Establish a local deflection program plan to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the services available.

Applicants will also be required to submit a financial and administrative risk assessment utilizing an Internal Controls Questionnaire (ICQ) for SFY19 and obtain approval from their cognizant agencies before execution of the grant agreement.
