# VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS

## Introduction

The purpose of this funding opportunity is to serve hard-to-reach victims of crime through Illinois Level 1 Adult or Pediatric Trauma Centers.  Applicants may request a maximum of $1.1 million in federal funding for use over a 15-month period. The term of the grant agreement will commence upon its effective date. Based on program performance and fund availability, ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.

For the purposes of this funding opportunity, the following definitions will apply:

**Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Model**: A comprehensive service delivery model providing coordinated clinical and case management services for adult and/or minors victims of violent crime and their families who typically do not access services due to individual and cultural barriers to help seeking.

**Historically underserved or marginalized victims**: Historically underserved or marginalized victims may not seek services for a variety of reasons, including stigma, stereotypes, and social norms that deter help seeking; a lack of knowledge on service availability, methods of access, and eligibility; concerns or past experiences with provider insensitivity to disabilities or cultural beliefs; and a lack of positive experience with the criminal justice system, including law enforcement, which is a frequent access point to victim services. Historically underserved or marginalized victims who may benefit from the low-barrier services that the TRC aims to provide may include individual who are homeless, individuals who are chronically mentally ill, immigrants and refugees, individuals who are disabled, people with severe trauma-related symptoms, and individuals of diverse ethnicities/origins.

**Direct services**: Efforts that respond to the emotional, psychological and physical needs of crime victims; assist victims to stabilize their lives after victimization; assist victims to understand and participate in the criminal justice system; or provide victims of crime with a measure of safety.

**See Notice of Funding Opportunity for program design, staff, and training requirements.**
