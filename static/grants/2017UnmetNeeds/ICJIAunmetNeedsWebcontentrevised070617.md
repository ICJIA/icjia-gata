#FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR 2017 VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILD ABUSE, FINANCIAL CRIME AND IMPARIED DRIVING VICTIM PROGRAMS
The purpose of this funding opportunity is to fund direct services for victims of crime under at least one of the three following focus areas: child abuse (minors and adults survivors of child abuse), financial crime, and impaired driving. Applicants may request a minimum of \$75,000 to a maximum of \$500,000 in federal funding for use over a 12-month period. The term of the grant agreement will commence upon its effective date. Based on program performance and fund availability, ICJIA may recommend allocation of funding to support an additional 24 months.

##FOCUS AREAS:

###Child Abuse:
Crimes committed by a parent, immediate family member, person responsible for the child's welfare, individual residing in the same home as the child, or a paramour of the child's parent in violation of Illinois criminal statutes that result in physical or emotional harm to a minor.  Covered in this funding opportunity will be minor victims and adult survivors of child abuse as defined here.

Child trafficking and involuntary servitude and bullying will not be addressed with this opportunity. 

Childhood exposure to violence is not the primary intent of this opportunity, however, services for such secondary victimization are allowable if the need is identified during the provision of child abuse services.

###Financial Crime:
Identity theft  or the financial exploitation of elders and persons with disabilities. 

###Impaired Driving:
Impaired driving occurs when a driver operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicating compounds.  This funding opportunity serves victims of motor vehicle accidents caused by impaired drivers and victims of motor vehicle accidents caused by drivers using electronic communication or video devices while driving which result in death or great bodily harm. 

See [Notice of Funding Opportunity](UNMETNEEDSNOFOwattachments.pdf), for program design, staff, and training requirements.
